# DPTV_ML_Particle_detection
Particle detection by means of neural networks and synthetic training data refinement in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV)

by Maximilian Dreisbach (Institute of Fluid Mechanics (ISTM) - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT))

This code allows the training of neural networks for particle detection in DPTV as well as the synthesis of refinemed synthetic training data as presented at in the MST special issue.

If you have any questions regarding this code, feel free to contact Maximilian (maximilian.dreisbach@kit.edu).
